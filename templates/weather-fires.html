    <h2>How Weather Conditions Influence Forest Fires</h2>
    <p>Forest fires are significantly influenced by various weather conditions. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and preventing wildfires.</p>

    <h3>1. Temperature</h3>
    <p>High temperatures dry out vegetation, making it more susceptible to ignition. Prolonged heatwaves can worsen the risk.</p>

    <h3>2. Humidity</h3>
    <p>Low humidity levels result in dry air, which dries out vegetation and increases fire risk. Relative humidity below 30% is considered hazardous.</p>

    <h3>3. Wind Speed</h3>
    <p>Strong winds can rapidly spread fires by carrying embers over long distances. Wind also provides oxygen, intensifying the flames.</p>

    <h3>4. Rainfall</h3>
    <p>While rainfall can prevent fires, lack of precipitation leads to drought conditions, increasing fire susceptibility.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>Monitoring these weather patterns is essential for early fire detection and prevention. Tools like Fire Weather Indices (FWI) use weather data to predict fire risks.</p>
